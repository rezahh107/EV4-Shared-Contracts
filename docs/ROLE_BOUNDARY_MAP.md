# EV4 Role Boundary Map

Status: `PROMPT-03` runner boundary infrastructure added on branch `project-gate-prompt-03-runner-boundary`. This document records repository boundaries for Project Gate implementation planning. It is coordination documentation, not a promotion of any specialist contract into Project Gate ownership.

## Authority rule

Specialist repositories remain authoritative for their schemas, validators, adapters, fixtures, and domain behavior. Project Gate may pin, hash, call, validate, report, and package handoffs. It must not replace specialist logic.

| Repository | Role | Owns | Must Not Own | Allowed Outputs | Blocked Outputs | Downstream Consumer | Current Authority Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `rezahh107/EV4-Architect-Repo` | Architect | Architecture decisions; selected candidate identity; approved structure model; class intent; forbidden work; Architect Stage Payload `ev4-architect-stage-payload@1.0.0`; Architect semantic validator and fixtures | Constructability proof; Builder runtime authorization; Builder execution; Responsive correctness; production readiness | Architect Stage Payload; architecture handoff evidence; CE-intake source data | Builder-ready runtime package; CE proof; Responsive completion; real Elementor validation | Project Gate, then CE | repo-local authoritative for Architect-owned design/handoff concepts |
| `rezahh107/EV4-Constructability-Engineer-Repo` | Constructability Engineer | Constructability review; implementation-strategy proof; canonical Architect-facing CE intake `ev4-ce-architect-stage-intake@1.1.0`; CE-owned mapping `ev4-architect-stage-to-ce-intake-mapping@1.1.0`; Builder Executable Package producer semantics | Architect redesign; Builder runtime execution; Builder adapter projection; Responsive repair; production readiness | CE intake validation; CE review output; Builder Executable Package when evidence-gated | Builder runtime output; Builder compact `node:model` carriers in CE source output; production-ready claims | Project Gate, then Builder | repo-local authoritative for CE review/gating and executable handoff issuance |
| `rezahh107/EV4-Builder-Assistant-Repo` | Builder | Runtime intake validation; `ev4-builder-context-package@1.0.0`; CE→Builder Contract Gate; CE→Builder adapter; Builder action batch, layout check, completion gate, and real Elementor execution evidence validators | Architecture decisions; CE strategy proof; Responsive conclusions; production readiness; invention of missing Golden Reference / Build Intent Brief / Spatial Lexicon | Normalized Builder runtime intake; execution/build evidence; Builder-side validation decisions | Architect-only package treated as Builder-ready; CE review-only package treated as runtime-ready; Responsive correctness claims | Project Gate, then Responsive | repo-local authoritative for Builder runtime intake, execution behavior, and Builder-owned evidence surfaces |
| `rezahh107/EV4-Responsive-Architect` | Responsive Architect | Responsive input eligibility; `ev4-builder-responsive-input@0.1.0`; responsive output `ev4-responsive-output@0.3.0`; viewport evidence gates; Responsive repair semantics; responsive handoff export family | Original architecture selection; CE constructability proof; Builder execution; mobile/tablet inference from desktop-only evidence; final readiness without evidence | Responsive input eligibility decisions; responsive output; viewport-scoped evidence; repair outputs when authorized | Raw screenshot as baseline authority; frontend/export/accessibility/production claims without evidence | Project Gate final gate | repo-local authoritative for responsive adaptation, viewport evidence, and Responsive-owned output concepts |
| `rezahh107/EV4-Project-Gate` | Project Gate | Stage Evidence Bundle envelope; transition/result schemas; diagnostic schema; lock manifest schema; deterministic canonical JSON and SHA-256; pinned external contract verification; orchestration of official validators/adapters through `src/ev4_transition/runners/`; diagnostics; Persian summaries; behavioral coverage ledger | Specialist schemas as canonical copies; CE constructability logic; Builder runtime logic; Responsive repair logic; evidence invention; silent normalization; accepted/final claims without evidence; subprocess execution outside `src/ev4_transition/runners/` | Validation results; transition results; pinned/hash reports; next-stage packages only when owner contracts/evidence validate; repair/insufficient-evidence diagnostics | Specialist logic; copied owner schemas; synthetic fixtures described as real evidence; production readiness claims | User and next specialist repository | Project Gate-owned orchestration authority only |

## Boundary invariants

```yaml
project_gate:
  may:
    - validate_envelopes
    - verify_schema_identity
    - pin_refs_commits_paths
    - compute_sha256_hashes
    - call_official_validators
    - call_official_adapters
    - produce_diagnostics
    - emit_json_results
    - write_persian_summaries
  must_not:
    - copy_specialist_schemas_as_canonical_truth
    - implement_CE_constructability_logic
    - implement_Builder_runtime_logic
    - implement_Responsive_repair_logic
    - invent_evidence
    - silently_normalize_specialist_outputs
    - emit_accepted_without_explicit_evidence
```

## Prompt 01 boundary update

`PROMPT-01` adds Project Gate-owned contract carriers and deterministic namespace structure only:

```text
schemas/diagnostic/diagnostic.v1.schema.json
schemas/lock-manifest/lock-manifest.v1.schema.json
src/ev4_transition/core/
src/ev4_transition/stage_bundle/
src/ev4_transition/locks/
src/ev4_transition/presentation/status_mapping.py
```

No CE→Builder, Builder→Responsive, final gate, specialist validator/adapter expansion, or specialist domain logic is implemented in this prompt.

## PROMPT-03 runner boundary

Only `src/ev4_transition/runners/` may execute subprocesses for official specialist validators or adapters.

```yaml
runner_boundary:
  allowed_inside:
    - src/ev4_transition/runners/subprocess_runner.py imports and calls subprocess
    - src/ev4_transition/runners/official_tools.py builds official validator/adapter commands
    - src/ev4_transition/runners/records.py creates execution records
    - src/ev4_transition/runners/failure_mapping.py maps failures to deterministic Project Gate statuses
  forbidden_outside:
    - subprocess imports or calls
    - os.system
    - shell=True
    - importlib-based dynamic specialist imports
    - direct Python/Node command execution for specialist tools
  scanner:
    - scripts/check-runner-boundary.py
```

`src/ev4_transition/validator_runner.py` is now a compatibility wrapper for the existing Architect→CE CLI path. It does not execute subprocesses directly; it delegates official validator execution to `src/ev4_transition/runners/`.

The runner boundary is infrastructure only. It does not implement CE→Builder transition logic, Builder→Responsive transition logic, final gate logic, fallback adapter behavior, CE constructability logic, Builder runtime logic, or Responsive repair logic.

## Current implementation boundary summary

```yaml
implemented:
  - Project Gate deterministic core
  - Stage Evidence Bundle validation
  - structured diagnostics
  - canonical JSON and SHA-256
  - Project Gate diagnostic and lock carrier schemas
  - status presentation mapping
  - Architect-to-CE transition orchestration
  - official Architect and CE validator calls for pinned local checkouts
  - runner boundary for official validator/adapter subprocess execution
  - local-only mockable repo access abstraction
  - sanitized runtime progress events
  - static runner-boundary scanner
not_implemented:
  - CE-to-Builder Project Gate transition
  - Builder-to-Responsive Project Gate transition
  - final evidence gate
  - UI/upload-download application
  - real Elementor artifact validation
```

## Known baseline drift

```yaml
- id: DRIFT-B2R-RESPONSIVE-INPUT
  description: Previous Project Gate freeze docs described Responsive Builder-specific input as not implemented. Live Responsive repo now has schema-bound non-executing ev4-builder-responsive-input@0.1.0 and validator.
  action: update transition boundary map and future lock baseline before PROMPT-05.
- id: DRIFT-A2C-STATUS-ARCHITECT-README
  description: Architect README still says Project Gate Architect-to-CE transition is not implemented. Live Project Gate repo records it as implemented.
  action: treat Architect README statement as stale for Project Gate implementation status, but do not modify specialist repos in PROMPT-01.
- id: STATUS-MODEL-LEGACY-VALID
  description: Current Stage Bundle validation and existing Architect→CE paths retain legacy valid status compatibility while Prompt 01 adds target status presentation mapping.
  action: future transition prompts should emit accepted/repair_needed/insufficient_evidence/invalid directly once evidence gates are implemented.
```
