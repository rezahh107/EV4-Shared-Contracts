## Current Phase

| Phase | Status |
|---|---|
| Phase 4 — Minimal shared governance | completed |
| Phase 4.1 — Promotion proposal intake | completed |
| Phase 4.2 — Audit correction | completed |
| Phase 5 — First proposal-only candidate | completed as `PROPOSAL_ONLY` |
| Phase 5.1 — Status-after-merge automation | completed |
| Phase 6 — Shared schema migration | blocked |

## Completed in Status Finalization

- Confirmed PR #5 was merged and its stale `PR open` / `CI_PENDING` status was corrected.
- Confirmed PR #6 was merged into `main`.
- Confirmed PR #6 `Skeleton Health` completed successfully before merge.
- Preserved the non-authoritative / no-canonical-migration boundary.
- Kept startup reading order aligned for future agents.

## Completed in Phase 5 Proposal Pass

- Selected `reference_paradigm_lock` as the first proposal-only readiness candidate.
- Avoided `ev4-builder-context-package@1.0.0` because its split risk remains unresolved.
- Added `docs/proposals/0001-reference-paradigm-lock-readiness.md`.
- Recorded the proposal verdict as `PROPOSAL_ONLY`.
- Did not add active schemas, shared fixtures, shared runtime validation scripts, or runtime dependencies.
- Did not modify the four existing EV4 ecosystem repositories.

## Completed in Phase 5.1 Status Automation Pass

- Added `scripts/update-status-after-merge.js` to update merge facts in `docs/EV4_SHARED_CONTRACTS_STATUS.md`.
- Added `.github/workflows/status-after-merge.yml` to run after a PR is merged into `main`.
- Added an explicit `AGENTS.md` guardrail: automation may record merge facts only and must not infer CI success, promotion approval, or canonical migration.
- Avoided third-party commit actions; the workflow uses native `git commit` / `git push` with `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
- Merged PR #7 after `Skeleton Health` passed.
- Confirmed the newly installed automation recorded PR #7 in `Automated Merge Ledger`.
- Did not add active schemas, shared fixtures, shared runtime validation scripts, or runtime dependencies.
- Did not modify the four existing EV4 ecosystem repositories.

- Status automation after PR #7 merge: `confirmed` for merge-fact recording.
- CI/check status for this final direct status-file commit: `CI_NOT_VERIFIED` until a matching workflow run is visible.

## Automated Merge Ledger

This section is updated by GitHub Actions after a pull request is merged. It records merge facts only. It must not be treated as schema promotion, CI proof, or canonical migration approval.

| PR | Title | Head branch | Head commit | Merge commit | Recorded by |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `#7` | `Automate status file merge ledger updates` | `automation/status-after-merge` | `96548866ec544009645d4b501fba7eb617d666ad` | `4b48422bf7f95cc4682c0c4a871d441cef1a17a4` | `rezahh107 on rezahh107/EV4-Shared-Contracts` |

## Remaining Blockers

- Full cross-repo CI evidence is incomplete.
- `ev4-builder-context-package@1.0.0` split risk is unresolved.
- Shared schema migration is still not approved.
- `reference_paradigm_lock` lacks direct consumer evidence, schema stability evidence, versioning policy, fixtures, producer/consumer validation, cross-repo compatibility test, ADR, and CI evidence.
- No contract may be promoted until owner, producer, consumer, fixtures, validation, CI, migration, rollback, and ADR evidence all exist.

## Next Immediate Action

Start a source-evidence audit for `reference_paradigm_lock` in `rezahh107/EV4-Constructability-Engineer-Repo` and `rezahh107/EV4-Builder-Assistant-Repo`. The output must remain evidence/readiness-only and must not modify those repositories unless explicitly requested.

## Simple Persian Mental Model

این repo مثل دفتر قوانین مشترک است.

از merge بعدی، یک منشی ماشینی شماره PR و commitها را در دفتر ثبت می‌کند.

اما منشی حق ندارد مهر CI، promotion یا canonical migration بزند؛ آن مهرها هنوز فقط با شواهد و review انسانی/agent زده می‌شوند.
