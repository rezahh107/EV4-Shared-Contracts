## Files changed

- `docs/evidence/JOIN_EVIDENCE_PACKET_v1.json`
- `docs/evidence/JOIN_EVIDENCE_PACKET_v1.md`
- `docs/handoffs/PROMPT-04_5_HANDOFF.md`

## Repair applied after PR Inspector review

- Added explicit discrepancy coverage for both Prompt 0 hash gaps:
  - `contracts/common/producer-gate-export.v1.schema.json`
  - `schemas/stage-bundle/stage-bundle.v1.schema.json`
- Added explicit discrepancy coverage for required artifact hash gaps in all four Producer entries:
  - `architect`
  - `ce`
  - `builder`
  - `responsive`
- Changed CE `stage_bundle_schema` from `not_applicable` to `insufficient_evidence` because the common Producer Gate Export contract requires `final_stage_bundle` and no CE exception was verified.
- Added terminology clarification that path-observed artifact status does not mean hash-verified readiness.
- Kept `prompt_5_ready: false`.

## Tests run

```bash
python -m json.tool docs/evidence/JOIN_EVIDENCE_PACKET_v1.json >/tmp/join-evidence-packet.pretty.json
```

Result: `passed` on the generated repair JSON before repository write.

## CI observation

CI evidence is head-specific.

For head `2d21ae9a4e8934513cb427714e76a4e7a0f6e29b`, the following Project Gate workflows were observed as `completed` / `success` before the later documentation synchronization updates:

- `UI Runtime Smoke`
- `Prompt 06 Report UX`
- `Prompt 05 Builder Responsive Final Gate`
- `Skeleton Health`

After any later documentation-only commit, exact-head CI must be rechecked before merge. Do not treat an older head's CI result as current if the PR head SHA has changed.

## Tests not run

- Repository validator was not run locally because no checkout was available.
- `git show <commit_sha>:<path> | sha256sum` was not run; local GitHub network access failed.
- CI job logs were not downloaded; only workflow run status/conclusion metadata was inspected.

## Capability limitations

`git_show_blob` SHA-256 verification remains `UNAVAILABLE`. GitHub connector evidence is fallback only.

## Hash method used

Required method recorded: `git show <commit_sha>:<path>`. Actual SHA-256 status: `insufficient_evidence`.

## Discrepancies found

Blocking:

- `hash_not_recorded` / `project_gate_prompt_0` / `contracts/common/producer-gate-export.v1.schema.json`
- `hash_not_recorded` / `project_gate_prompt_0` / `schemas/stage-bundle/stage-bundle.v1.schema.json`
- `producer_required_artifact_hashes_not_git_show_verified` / `architect`
- `producer_required_artifact_hashes_not_git_show_verified` / `ce`
- `producer_required_artifact_hashes_not_git_show_verified` / `builder`
- `producer_required_artifact_hashes_not_git_show_verified` / `responsive`
- `ce_stage_bundle_schema_insufficient_evidence` / `ce`
- `missing_standard_handoff` / `ce`

Warnings:

- `stale_handoff_pending_merge` / `architect`
- `stale_handoff_old_head_sha` / `architect`
- `stale_handoff_pending_merge` / `builder`
- `stale_handoff_pending_merge` / `responsive`
- `stale_handoff_branch_mismatch` / `responsive`

## Readiness decision

`prompt_5_ready: false`

Prompt 5 must not proceed until blockers are resolved.

## Next allowed prompt

`Prompt 4.5 evidence repair`: rerun with real Git object access and reconcile/accept CE fallback handoff and CE Stage Bundle dependency evidence.

## No-false-execution notes

- Producer repositories were not modified.
- Project Gate runtime code was not modified.
- CI pass is claimed only for the previously observed head `2d21ae9a4e8934513cb427714e76a4e7a0f6e29b`; current exact-head CI must be rechecked after documentation updates.
- No `accepted` or Prompt 5 readiness claim is emitted.
