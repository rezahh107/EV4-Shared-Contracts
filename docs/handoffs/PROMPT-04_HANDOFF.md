coverage_rules_advanced:
  - PG-C2B-001: ci_enforced for PROMPT-04 baseline; exact owner file-byte SHA-256 lock values are committed and lock verification passed.
  - PG-C2B-002: ci_enforced for PROMPT-04 baseline; official CE validator, Builder gate, Builder adapter, Builder output validator path passed in CI smoke.
  - PG-VALIDATOR-001: ci_enforced for C2B owner validator path.
  - PG-ADAPTER-001: ci_enforced for Builder adapter path and fallback-adapter negative fixture.
  - PG-SYNTH-001: ci_enforced for synthetic/evidence distinction, with smoke explicitly non-real handoff evidence.
  - PG-SCHEMA-001: ci_enforced for Project Gate-owned result schema allowlist and no copied specialist schema files.
coverage_rules_still_gap:
  - PG-DOWNSTREAM-001 remains fixture_tested and not downstream_contract_enforced.
  - Real non-synthetic CE→Builder handoff evidence remains insufficient.

new_or_changed_ci:
  - Added C2B pytest log artifact on failure.
  - Added computed C2B lock hash manifest artifact.
  - Added C2B lock verification diagnostic artifact on failure.
  - Added C2B live smoke diagnostic artifact on failure.
  - Added C2B compute-lock step before lock verification.

important_design_decisions:
  - PR #20 stayed draft and was not merged.
  - Exact lock hashes were computed by GitHub Actions from pinned owner checkouts, then committed to contracts/locks/ce-to-builder-transition.v1.lock.json.
  - Builder adapter script identity marker changed to CE_BUILDER_PACKAGE_TRANSFORM_IDS because that marker exists in the pinned owner script.
  - Builder adapter contract identity marker changed to CE Builder Package Adapter Contract because the pinned owner contract document does not contain normalizeCeBuilderExecutablePackage as text.
  - CE package validator runner now writes a minimal CE review wrapper plus builder_executable_package because CE package mode expects constructability_review state as well as the package.
  - PyYAML was added as a dependency because the official CE validator imports yaml.
  - The C2B smoke uses a Builder-owned adapter-valid fixture when available; it is integration evidence, not real EV4 handoff evidence.
  - Attempted docs/DIAGNOSTIC_CODES.md refresh encountered a 409 stale-SHA conflict and was not applied.
