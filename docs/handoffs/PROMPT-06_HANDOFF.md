tests_failed: []
tests_not_run:
  - full local live-checkout pytest from this environment: unavailable because github.com DNS resolution failed earlier
  - dependency metadata scan: not performed
coverage_rules_advanced:
  - PG-STATUS-001: validator_backed
  - PG-OUTPUT-001: validator_backed
  - PG-PROGRESS-001: validator_backed
  - PG-UNICODE-001: validator_backed
  - PG-THEME-001: validator_backed
  - PG-BRC-001: remains fixture_tested; standards traceability added as carrier
coverage_rules_still_gap:
  - Prompt-06 UX/report rules are not promoted to fixture_tested because dedicated behavioral fixtures are not yet bound through the behavioral coverage validator.
  - No downstream_contract_enforced status is claimed.
new_diagnostics:
  - none added to deterministic transition decision logic
  - report renderers surface existing diagnostic codes as LTR/copyable technical fragments
new_or_changed_cli:
  - ev4-transition --format persian now uses report renderer for status payloads
  - JSON output remains canonical and undecorated
new_or_changed_ci:
  - .github/workflows/prompt-06.yml added
  - Prompt-06 workflow now explicitly sets permissions.contents=read
  - Prompt-06 checkout now sets persist-credentials=false
  - tests/reporting/test_workflow_permissions.py validates Prompt-06 least-privilege workflow contract
  - Prompt-06 workflow runs UX acceptance, typography acceptance, theme acceptance, reporting, atomic writer, and behavioral coverage checks
important_design_decisions:
  - Phase 1 remains CLI plus generated Persian reports; no local web UI or desktop UI was added.
  - status_mapping.py remains the status-presentation SSOT.
  - Report rendering deep-copies result payloads and does not mutate deterministic result objects.
  - Progress events are excluded only from report-level hash calculation; transition logic was not changed.
  - File fsync before os.replace remains strict.
  - Directory fsync after os.replace is best-effort to avoid false failure after a successful atomic replacement.
  - Atomic writer reports success/download only after final path existence is confirmed.
  - Persian reports use RTL containers; technical identifiers use LTR isolation and monospace code wrappers.
  - Theme tokens are explicit for light/dark mode; dark tokens are not simple inversion.
web_sources_used:
  - Python official docs: os.replace atomic destination replacement semantics
  - Python official docs: os.fsync after file flush for disk write
  - Python official docs: tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile temporary output behavior
  - GitHub official docs: permissions key configures minimum required workflow access
  - actions/checkout README: persist-credentials false disables persisted checkout credentials
next_allowed_prompt: PROMPT-07 closure audit / stale prose cleanup / release readiness review
blocking_issues:
  - none known after PRF-001 and PRF-002 repair, subject to later PR Inspector re-review
remaining_insufficient_evidence:
  - real non-synthetic CE-to-Builder transition evidence
  - real Builder execution evidence bundle
  - real Responsive input/output evidence bundle
  - accessibility, export, and frontend correctness evidence
  - downstream owner rejection evidence for downstream_contract_enforced claims
```

## Review repair notes

- `PRF-001` was fixed by adding explicit `permissions: contents: read` and `persist-credentials: false` to `.github/workflows/prompt-06.yml`, plus a static regression test.
- `PRF-002` was fixed by making only directory-level fsync after `os.replace()` best-effort while preserving strict file fsync before replacement, plus regression tests for both cases.
- `PRF-003` remains non-blocking. Optional HTML output should not be advertised as a real HTML report until renamed or converted/tested as true HTML.
- This prompt intentionally did not change transition acceptance, invalid, repair-needed, or insufficient-evidence decision logic.
