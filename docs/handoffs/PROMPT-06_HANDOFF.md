# PROMPT-06 Handoff

## Patch 4 — Final Operator Panel UX Hardening

```yaml
patch_id: PROMPT-06-UI-PATCH-4
branch: ux/operator-panel-final-hardening-patch-4
pull_request: 38
base_branch: main
base_context:
  patch_3_pr: 37
  patch_3_status: merged
review_follow_up:
  inspector_status_received: RED_DO_NOT_MERGE
  inspector_blockers:
    - required CI failed on reviewed head 1d8254f670762525f898a7f68c72fd4b21265d8f
    - manual/browser QA not evidenced
  ci_repair_action:
    - updated tests/ui/test_operator_panel.py to align the Markdown report regression test with Patch 4 report hardening: report.md intentionally contains both Raw diagnostics and Raw JSON result code blocks.
  optional_low_risk_item:
    - _preflight_summary_markdown explicit-None fallback was identified as a non-blocking defensive improvement; a direct adapters.py rewrite attempt was blocked by the connector safety layer, so this remains deferred unless patched from a local checkout.

ci_evidence_before_handoff_doc_update:
  head_sha: e628f4b90a48e1a75fcd6b14dd963ddcb686d332
  workflow_results:
    - Skeleton Health: success
    - Prompt 06 Report UX: success
    - UI Runtime Smoke: success
    - Prompt 05 Builder Responsive Final Gate: success
tests_run:
  - local syntax check in sandbox on generated Python patch files: python -m py_compile /mnt/data/patch4/*.py
  - GitHub Actions on head e628f4b90a48e1a75fcd6b14dd963ddcb686d332: Skeleton Health, Prompt 06 Report UX, UI Runtime Smoke, Prompt 05 Builder Responsive Final Gate all success
tests_not_run:
  - browser launch / screenshot QA from this connector environment
  - manual visual QA from this connector environment
coverage_rules_advanced:
  - PG-UNICODE-001: added centralized RTL helper contract tests and report/preflight LTR isolation tests.
  - PG-OUTPUT-001: added final output-state regression tests for validation-only, output null, and CE output produced language.
  - PG-GUIDANCE-001: added required diagnostic guidance coverage test for known operator diagnostics.
  - PG-REPORT-001: strengthened report artifact expectations for operational guidance, grouped diagnostics, raw diagnostics, and raw JSON LTR code blocks.
  - PG-THEME-001: added final theme token contract tests for semantic tokens, status icon/label/tone, focus ring, code background, and non-inversion dark mode.
coverage_rules_still_gap:
  - Browser visual QA remains manual, not screenshot-test enforced.
  - Accessibility completion remains insufficient_evidence; keyboard/focus sanity is documented for manual QA only.
  - Real Elementor/frontend/responsive readiness remains out of scope and insufficient_evidence.
new_diagnostics:
  - none; no transition diagnostic semantics changed.
cli_or_ci_changes:
  - none.
important_design_decisions:
  - Created src/ev4_transition/presentation/rtl.py as the small shared presentation helper module.
  - Kept src/ev4_transition/presentation/bidi.py as a compatibility wrapper to avoid breaking existing imports.
  - Hardened UI report artifacts without changing run_gate_request, transition execution, schema validation, canonical JSON, hash behavior, or status mapping.
  - Added docs/OPERATOR_PANEL_UX_CONTRACT.md as the final UX SSOT for the local operator panel.
  - Added docs/OPERATOR_PANEL_MANUAL_QA.md for final human QA before personal local operation.
  - Kept raw diagnostics and raw JSON as separate Markdown code blocks; updated the legacy Markdown fence regression test accordingly.
web_sources_used:
  - none.
repository_sources_inspected:
  - README.md
  - src/ev4_transition/ui/app.py

next_allowed_prompt: PROMPT-06 final patch review after CI evidence for the current final head, then PROMPT-07 closure audit
blockers:
  - manual/browser QA cannot be performed from this connector environment.
  - CI must be rechecked on the current head after this handoff documentation update before merge.
remaining_insufficient_evidence:
  - production readiness
  - real Elementor validation
  - frontend correctness
  - responsive correctness
  - accessibility completion
  - browser screenshot QA
  - real non-synthetic downstream evidence for later transition claims
```

## Scope note

Patch 4 intentionally does not change Project Gate validation logic, transition behavior, schema rules, canonical JSON behavior, hashing, status mapping, official specialist validators, specialist repository contracts, or owner adapter semantics.
