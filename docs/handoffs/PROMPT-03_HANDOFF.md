tests_run:
  - local synthetic-tree subset in ChatGPT container: PYTHONPATH=src pytest -q -> 19 passed
  - live GitHub file fetch sanity check after branch update: docs/BEHAVIORAL_RULE_COVERAGE.md ref project-gate-prompt-03-runner-boundary returned PROMPT-03 content
tests_passed:
  - local synthetic-tree subset: 19 passed
  - static/source syntax indirectly covered in local synthetic subset for new modules and tests
tests_failed: []
tests_not_run:
  - full live repository clone/install: not run because container network could not resolve github.com
  - python -m pip install -e '.[dev]' against live branch
  - full live branch pytest
  - python scripts/check-runner-boundary.py against a live clone
  - ev4-transition coverage validate docs/BEHAVIORAL_RULE_COVERAGE.md against a live clone
  - npm run status
  - npm run validate
  - GitHub Actions current PR/head checks: pending until draft PR/checks run
coverage_rules_advanced:
  - PG-BOUNDARY-001: static runner boundary scanner added; src/ev4_transition/validator_runner.py no longer imports/calls subprocess directly; CI step references added.
  - PG-VALIDATOR-001: official validator execution API added under src/ev4_transition/runners/ with fail-closed mappings for missing, timeout, command not found, unparseable output, repair-needed, contract violation, and execution failure.
  - PG-ADAPTER-001: official adapter execution API added under src/ev4_transition/runners/ with missing/timeout fail-closed behavior and explicit fallback adapter rejection.
  - PG-PROGRESS-001: sanitized runtime progress events added; token/env/stdout/stderr/private absolute path leakage is rejected; progress is excluded from canonical result hash.
  - PG-EVIDENCE-001: execution record carriers added for official tool execution evidence; stdout/stderr are recorded by SHA-256 hash only.
coverage_rules_still_gap:
  - PG-VALIDATOR-001 remains validator_backed in the machine-readable coverage ledger until behavioral coverage fixture-family binding supports runner tests and CI evidence exists.
  - PG-ADAPTER-001 remains validator_backed until PROMPT-04 adds real official CE→Builder adapter execution evidence.
  - PG-PROGRESS-001 remains validator_backed until PR CI evidence exists and PROMPT-06 adds full Persian RTL/LTR report UX fixtures.
  - PG-DOWNSTREAM-001 remains fixture_tested for false downstream-enforcement claim prevention only; real downstream contracts remain insufficient_evidence.
  - PG-STATUS-001 legacy valid compatibility still exists in existing Stage Bundle/A2C paths.

new_or_changed_cli:
  - scripts/check-runner-boundary.py added as repository script; no ev4-transition CLI subcommand added in PROMPT-03.
new_or_changed_ci:
  - .github/workflows/validate.yml runs python scripts/check-runner-boundary.py.
  - .github/workflows/validate.yml runs pytest tests/runners.
  - .github/workflows/validate.yml runs pytest tests/progress.
  - .github/workflows/validate.yml runs pytest tests/boundary.
  - .github/workflows/validate.yml keeps existing behavioral coverage validator and fixture validation steps.
important_design_decisions:
  - Only src/ev4_transition/runners/ imports and calls subprocess for official specialist tools.
  - src/ev4_transition/validator_runner.py remains as compatibility wrapper for existing Architect→CE CLI behavior and delegates to runners.
  - Runner records store stdout_hash/stderr_hash, not raw stdout/stderr.
  - Timeouts, missing commands, missing validators/adapters, and unparseable output are insufficient_evidence, never success.
  - Fallback adapter use is invalid and emits PG.ADAPTER.FALLBACK_FORBIDDEN.
  - Progress events are runtime/UI artifacts and are deliberately excluded from canonical final result hashing.
  - Repo access is local-only and mockable in Phase 1; remote connector behavior remains outside deterministic core.
  - PROMPT-03 intentionally does not implement CE→Builder, Builder→Responsive, final gate, or specialist business logic.
web_sources_used: []
next_allowed_prompt: PROMPT-04 after current PR head CI is green and owner accepts/merges this PR; otherwise fix PROMPT-03 CI/test failures first.
blocking_issues:
  - Full live-repo tests were not run locally because clone/install was unavailable in the container.
  - GitHub Actions evidence is pending until draft PR/checks run.
remaining_insufficient_evidence:
  - Current PR/head CI result for PROMPT-03 additions.
  - Real CE-to-Builder downstream rejection evidence.
  - Real Builder-to-Responsive downstream rejection evidence.
  - Official Builder adapter execution evidence.
  - Official Responsive validation evidence.
  - Final evidence gate policy, fixtures, and CI evidence.
