## Visual issues fixed

- Added semantic control indicator tokens for Light and Dark themes.
- Exported `--ev4-control-indicator-*` CSS variables.
- Replaced radio-only reliance on browser default `accent-color` with scoped explicit radio indicator CSS under `.gradio-container`.
- Added visible unselected, selected, hover, and focus-visible radio states.
- Added explicit dark header selectors for `body.dark`, `.dark`, `:root[data-theme="dark"]`, and system dark fallback.
- Kept Light Mode header clean and token-backed.

## Design decisions

- Used Project Gate semantic token architecture rather than copying `EV4-Workbook-Jinja` palette or UI identity.
- Transferred only the principles of shell-level theme coherence, layered dark surfaces, visible controls, restrained accents, focus visibility, and readable Persian line-height.
- Kept the patch CSS-scoped to `.gradio-container` or `.ev4-header` rather than modifying service or transition behavior.
- Kept dark radio checked dot dark-on-bright for measurable UI contrast.

## Reference repo files inspected

```text
rezahh107/EV4-Workbook-Jinja:templates/base.html.j2
rezahh107/EV4-Workbook-Jinja:templates/partials/head.html.j2
rezahh107/EV4-Workbook-Jinja:static/assets/css/workbook.css
```

Transferable findings:

- `html[data-theme="..."]` provides shell-level theme control.
- Dark mode uses layered non-white surfaces rather than isolated light cards.
- Form controls use visibly sized `input[type="checkbox"]` / `input[type="radio"]` and accent treatment.
- `:focus-visible` has a strong explicit outline.
- Persian UI font stack and generous line-height improve readability.

Non-transferable:

- Workbook gold/teal identity and educational workbook layout were not copied.

## Added or updated test coverage

- Theme token contract: control indicator tokens exist in Light and Dark.
- CSS export: `--ev4-control-indicator-*` variables are exported.
- CSS behavior: radio selectors, `:checked`, `:focus-visible`, checked dot/background variables are present.
- Dark header anti-regression: explicit dark header selectors are present.
- Contrast token coverage: radio border/background, checked dot/background, and focus ring/surface token pairs are included.
