coverage_rules_advanced:
  - PG-BRC-001: closure ledger refreshed without status inflation.
  - PG-BOUNDARY-001: stale boundary prose corrected to match implemented baselines while preserving Project Gate non-specialist boundary.
  - PG-DOWNSTREAM-001: confirmed no downstream_contract_enforced claim exists; real downstream rejection evidence remains insufficient_evidence.
coverage_rules_still_gap:
  - PG-DOWNSTREAM-001: real downstream owner rejection evidence is still not available.
  - PG-ADAPTER-001: remains validator_backed; dedicated behavioral adapter-failure fixtures are still future work.
  - PG-VALIDATOR-001: remains validator_backed; dedicated validator-failure fixtures are still future work.
  - PG-STATUS-001: remains validator_backed for UX/status presentation; dedicated behavioral fixtures are still future work.
  - PG-OUTPUT-001: remains validator_backed; dedicated output-write behavioral fixtures are still future work.
  - PG-UNICODE-001: remains validator_backed; representative Persian/LTR report fixtures are still future work.
  - PG-PROGRESS-001: remains validator_backed; dedicated progress-event fixtures are still future work.

important_design_decisions:
  - Closure audit did not add new transition logic, specialist schema copies, or specialist domain behavior.
  - Fixed stale canonical docs rather than creating duplicate boundary/policy docs.
  - Added docs/CLOSURE_AUDIT.md because the audit is substantial and should be independently readable.
  - Kept release classification at implementation_ready_with_known_gaps, not personal_use_ready, because Prompt-07 branch CI is pending and real non-synthetic EV4 evidence remains unavailable.
  - Kept Behavioral Rule Coverage conservative: no ci_enforced or downstream_contract_enforced claims were added.
  - Retained insufficient_evidence for real CE→Builder, Builder execution, Responsive input/output, accessibility/export/frontend correctness, and downstream owner rejection evidence.
web_sources_used: []
next_allowed_prompt: merge Prompt-07 PR only after PR checks pass and owner explicitly approves; after merge, the safe next engineering prompt is real evidence bundle intake design, not further closure cleanup.
blocking_issues:
  - Prompt-07 branch CI has not run yet at handoff creation time.
  - Local full clone/test execution is unavailable in this environment due DNS failure.
remaining_insufficient_evidence:
  - exact current main ref SHA/CI after Prompt-07 branch creation
  - real non-synthetic CE-to-Builder transition evidence
  - real Builder execution evidence bundle
  - real Responsive input and output evidence bundle
  - accessibility/export/frontend correctness evidence
  - downstream owner rejection evidence for any future downstream_contract_enforced claim
