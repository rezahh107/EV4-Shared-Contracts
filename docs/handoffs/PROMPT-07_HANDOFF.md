tests_run:
  - inspected GitHub repository metadata with write permissions available
  - attempted local clone in ChatGPT container; failed because github.com could not be resolved
  - inspected PR #24 metadata; state closed, merged true, head c8522cf36e65243dfebc3f9b2f0b3feb97cbedf4, merge commit d522e7d4b434cc337bfe9314116f5b4af61466cf
  - inspected workflow runs for PR #24 final head c8522cf36e65243dfebc3f9b2f0b3feb97cbedf4; Prompt 06 Report UX, Prompt 05 Builder Responsive Final Gate, Skeleton Health, and Historical Merge Ledger were successful
  - inspected canonical docs and workflows via GitHub connector
  - created draft PR #26 from project-gate-prompt-07-closure-audit to main
  - inspected initial PR #26 workflow runs for head 82e692e947a3e22a36a9888e1238b6068444ec3d; Prompt 05 Builder Responsive Final Gate failed at Prompt-05 transition and capability tests
  - inspected tests/test_cli.py and found compatibility expectation for docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.yaml repository.current_main_head_ci.status
  - repaired docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.yaml to preserve repository.current_main_head_ci while retaining Prompt-07 current_main_ref_ci detail
  - inspected PR #26 reviewed head 531960f76f1ca0f09b948b69578dbb968e464ff6 workflow runs; Prompt 06 Report UX, Prompt 05 Builder Responsive Final Gate, and Skeleton Health were successful
  - refreshed docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.yaml, docs/CLOSURE_AUDIT.md, and this handoff to remove stale Prompt-07 pending-check wording

tests_failed:
  - local git clone attempt failed due DNS resolution failure for github.com in the ChatGPT container
  - initial PR #26 Prompt 05 Builder Responsive Final Gate run 28755124409 failed before compatibility-key repair; failure was traced to closure doc drift against tests/test_cli.py expectation for current_main_head_ci
tests_not_run:
  - local python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
  - local pytest
  - local ev4-transition coverage validate docs/BEHAVIORAL_RULE_COVERAGE.md
  - local python scripts/check-runner-boundary.py
  - local fixture matrix tests
  - local CLI smoke tests
  - local report/UX/Typography tests
coverage_rules_advanced:
  - PG-BRC-001: closure ledger refreshed without status inflation.
  - PG-BOUNDARY-001: stale boundary prose corrected to match implemented baselines while preserving Project Gate non-specialist boundary.
  - PG-DOWNSTREAM-001: confirmed no downstream_contract_enforced claim exists; real downstream rejection evidence remains insufficient_evidence.
coverage_rules_still_gap:
  - PG-DOWNSTREAM-001: real downstream owner rejection evidence is still not available.
  - PG-ADAPTER-001: remains validator_backed; dedicated behavioral adapter-failure fixtures are still future work.
  - PG-VALIDATOR-001: remains validator_backed; dedicated validator-failure fixtures are still future work.
  - PG-STATUS-001: remains validator_backed for UX/status presentation; dedicated behavioral fixtures are still future work.
  - PG-OUTPUT-001: remains validator_backed; dedicated output-write behavioral fixtures are still future work.
  - PG-UNICODE-001: remains validator_backed; representative Persian/LTR report fixtures are still future work.
  - PG-PROGRESS-001: remains validator_backed; dedicated progress-event fixtures are still future work.

important_design_decisions:
  - Closure audit did not add new transition logic, specialist schema copies, or specialist domain behavior.
  - Fixed stale canonical docs rather than creating duplicate boundary/policy docs.
  - Added docs/CLOSURE_AUDIT.md because the audit is substantial and should be independently readable.
  - Kept release classification at implementation_ready_with_known_gaps, not personal_use_ready, because real non-synthetic EV4 evidence, frontend/export/accessibility correctness, and downstream owner rejection evidence remain unavailable.
  - Kept Behavioral Rule Coverage conservative: no ci_enforced or downstream_contract_enforced claims were added.
  - Retained insufficient_evidence for real CE→Builder, Builder execution, Responsive input/output, accessibility/export/frontend correctness, and downstream owner rejection evidence.
  - Preserved repository.current_main_head_ci as a compatibility key because existing tests depend on it; added current_main_ref_ci separately instead of renaming the old field.
  - Recorded Prompt-07 reviewed-head CI success without promoting the project to personal_use_ready.
web_sources_used: []
next_allowed_prompt: after the current PR head has green CI and owner explicitly approves, merge Prompt-07 PR; after merge, the safe next engineering prompt is real evidence bundle intake design, not further closure cleanup.
blocking_issues:
  - Local full clone/test execution is unavailable in this environment due DNS failure.
  - Current PR head changed after the stale-prose documentation refresh; observe GitHub Actions on the current head before merge.
remaining_insufficient_evidence:
  - exact current main ref SHA/CI after Prompt-07 branch merge, if merged
  - real non-synthetic CE-to-Builder transition evidence
  - real Builder execution evidence bundle
  - real Responsive input and output evidence bundle
  - accessibility/export/frontend correctness evidence
  - downstream owner rejection evidence for any future downstream_contract_enforced claim
