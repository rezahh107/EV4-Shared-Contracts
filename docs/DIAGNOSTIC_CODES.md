# EV4 Project Gate Diagnostic Codes

Status: `PROMPT-04` registry for Project Gate-owned diagnostics.

## Schema

Diagnostics are validated by:

```text
schemas/diagnostic/diagnostic.v1.schema.json
```

Required fields:

```yaml
code: stable Project Gate diagnostic code
severity: error | warning | info | insufficient_evidence
message: non-empty human-readable text
path: JSON path-like location
details: optional object
```

| `PG.C2B.REAL_EVIDENCE_REQUIRED` | `insufficient_evidence` | Project Gate | Raw CE package input was supplied where real non-synthetic Stage Evidence Bundle evidence is required. |
| `PG.C2B.SYNTHETIC_ONLY_EVIDENCE` | `insufficient_evidence` | Project Gate | Synthetic CE fixture was presented where real evidence is required. |
| `PG.C2B.ADAPTER_OUTPUT_UNPARSEABLE` | `insufficient_evidence` | Project Gate | Official Builder adapter did not produce parseable JSON object output. |
